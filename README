CakePHP Newsreaders plugin with Json Datasource

What is this?
Requirements was to create app for news subscribsion and store data in file, not DB.
So this is result of my 1.5 days of learning CakePHP - created plugin there subscribers list is stored in JSON file

Whats inside?
I took this Array Datasource and modified to work with JSON
Visitor can subscribe for news
Subscribers and news list are stored in JSON file
Administrator can login (admin/admin) and manage subscribers

There is still a lot to do..
Make bulletproof Jsondatasorce class
Adapt data relationship
Add some dynamics with JavaScript and Ajax for input validation and submit
Add some custom styling
Add more functions (unsubscribe, change news chanels, mailing and etc.) This is endless list :)
Do more testing

How to try?
To try please login with admin/admin

How to setup?
Copy to your CakePHP app plugins dir
Add data source config to your app
